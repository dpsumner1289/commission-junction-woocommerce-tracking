# Commission Junction Woocommerce Tracking
A dynamic PHP tracking code for Commission Junction clients, to be used on the Thank You page in WooCommerce sites.

1. Create a child theme with a functions.php file, and copy over the "thankyou.php" template file from the WooCommerce plugin files to your new child theme.

2. Within each of the files in this repository is some code and instructions on where to place the code.

3. Enjoy!
